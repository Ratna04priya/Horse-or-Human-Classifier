# Horse-or-Human-Classifier
_A no validation DL code , that classifies a image as a horse or a human depending upon the picture choose.
The picture can be input and provided to the model during run time._

This repository has three notebook files containing,
- horse or human classifier with validation 

- horse or human classifier without validation

- horse or human classifier with validation 150*150

In this files, we import the files from the directories having human pictures and horse pictures explicitly. We then use the images for training.
Common Steps used in files are:

1. Loading the train and test directories
2. Building a Small Model from Scratch
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Training
5. Visualizing Intermediate Representations
